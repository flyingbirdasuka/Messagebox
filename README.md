This Messagebox is made by making an API call in Laravel.

By using Authentication you can register / log in as a user. After logging in you will then see the multiple message box (send messages, sent messages, deleted messages).

You can create a message by selecting the users in the "To" section where all the available users are shown.

After sending the message you can find this message in the sent message box.

The tag on the message shows if you already read this message, after reading the message the tag changes automatically.

If you replay the message, the subject is automatically used and "Re:'' is added on the top of the subject. Also when you delete the message it is moved to the deleted messages box.
